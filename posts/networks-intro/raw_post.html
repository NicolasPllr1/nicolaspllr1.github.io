<p>Title: <strong>Easy Intro to Networks and the Internet</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>
  Before implementing a [[Rust Impl of mini HTTP Server|mini HTTP server]] (in
  Rust for more fun), let's make sure we have a decent
  <strong>mental model for networking</strong>. Before calling high-level APIs -
  Berkeley sockets style <code>accept</code>,
  <code>send</code>/<code>recv</code>, <code>connect</code>, ... - let's build
  our <strong>foundations</strong> first.
</p>
<h1>Layered Architecture</h1>
<p>
  Networks get complicated fast, so their architecture is designed in
  <em>layers</em>.
</p>
<p>
  A layer in the network stack does 3 things: - It offers <em>services</em> to
  the layer above itself while relying on the services provided by the layer
  below itself. - It exposes an <em>interface</em> for the upper layer to access
  its services - this is "vertical", happening on the same machine - It defines
  a <em>protocol</em> to communicate with a peer layer running on another
  machine - this is "horizontal", happening between two machines
</p>
<p>
  For example, web apps may speak HTTP with each other - this is their protocol
  - while vertically interfacing with a lower-level transport layers - typically
  speaking another protocol like TCP or UDP among themselves. In the drawing
  below, HTTP may be the protocol used by the top layer (layer 3), interfacing
  with layer 2 using the TCP protocol. ![[Layers - Interface and Protocols.svg |
  400]]
</p>
<p>
  The distinction between services and protocols is similar to the separation in
  OOP or APIs more generally between interfaces and "implementation details". In
  the drawing below, layer k+1 depends on the <em>services</em> exposed by layer
  k. Given that the interface exposing these services and the services
  themselves do not change, the protocol used by layers k can be changed: it
  does not matter from the pov of layer k. ![[Layer_ service VS
  protocol.excalidraw.svg | 400]]
</p>
<h1>From Physics to Apps</h1>
<h2>TCP/IP vs OSI in Short</h2>
<p>Two important models for networks are the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.</p>
<p>![[osi_tcpip_layer_mapping.png| 240]]</p>
<p>
  OSI is a "conceptually cleaner" than TCP/IP - precisely defining services,
  interfaces and protocols for all its <em>7 layers</em>. But it doesn’t map
  well onto real-world network implementations. In contrast, TCP/IP emerged
  <em>from</em> real-world networking implementations. It became the dominant
  model - winning the "<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars#Internet%E2%80%93OSI_Standards_War"
    >protocol war</a
  >" - as it was simpler, already well-implemented and free (see
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley sockets</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  We will focus on a mix of the two models, looking at the following layers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>application</li>
  <li>transport</li>
  <li>network</li>
  <li>link / data-link</li>
  <li>physical</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Physical Layer: Bits to Signals</h2>
<p>
  <strong
    >How do we send abstract "bits" - clean <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s
    from the programmer POV - through a physical medium like a copper wire
    ?</strong
  >
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Solving this is the job of the <em>physical layer</em>: bridging the gap
  between the world of bits and the world of atoms. This is about the raw
  "mechanical" transmission of digital information.
</p>
<p>
  The main task is to solve this is <em>encoding</em>: deciding what kind of
  physical phenomenon will <em>encode</em> bits. For example, a higher voltage
  may represent a <code>1</code> and a lower voltage a <code>0</code> (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero"
    >NRZ</a
  >). Transitions between physical states can also be used to encode information
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code">Manchester code</a>).
</p>
<p>
  To cope with physical mediums' imperfections - e.g. noise, limited hardware
  precision - techniques like thresholding, timings and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_recovery">clock recovery</a>, and
  error detections are used.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>

  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. Link Layer: Local Networks (LAN)</h2>
<p>
  When multiple computers share the same physical medium—whether that’s Wi-Fi or
  an Ethernet cable—<strong
    >how does one machine make sure its message reaches the right
    destination?</strong
  >
  This is the job of the <strong>link layer</strong>, which manages
  communication between devices on the <em>same local network segment</em> (or
  <strong>LAN</strong>, Local Area Network).
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The link layer introduces <strong>addresses</strong> (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address"
    >MAC addresses</a
  >) so that devices can recognize which messages are meant for them. It also
  handles how these messages are packaged into units called
  <strong>frames</strong>, and how to avoid chaos when several machines try to
  send data at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  To communicate reliably on a shared medium, each device is assigned a
  <strong>MAC address</strong>—a unique hardware identifier. When your laptop
  sends a message to your router over Wi-Fi or Ethernet, it wraps that message
  in a frame containing the MAC address of the intended receiver.
</p>
<p>
  This wrapping process is called <strong>encapsulation</strong> and happens
  throughout the layer stack:
</p>
<pre><code>frame = header + payload (+ optional trailer)
</code></pre>
<p>
  The header includes essential information like source and destination MAC
  addresses. The payload is your actual message. Trailers may include things
  like error-detection codes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Encapsulation happens at every layer in the stack</strong>—each layer
  adds its own header (and sometimes trailer) as the message goes down the stack
  and removes them as it goes up on the receiving side. This process of adding
  and removing headers is called
  <strong>encapsulation and decapsulation</strong>.
</p>
<p>encapsulation, TCP/IP Illustrated 1: ![[encapsulation_tanenbum.png| 420]]</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit">PDU</a>: Protocol
    Data Unit
  </li>
  <li>
    Note that special names are used to describe each layer PDU:
    <ul>
      <li>
        signals (physical) --> frames (link) --> packets (network) --> segments
        (transport) --> messages (app)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  What happens if two devices try to send data at the same time? On older
  <strong>shared Ethernet</strong> setups (where all machines were wired onto a
  single cable), this led to collisions—two signals interfering with each other.
  ![[classic_ethernet_tanenbum.png| 420]] Protocols like
  <strong>CSMA/CD</strong> (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
  Detection) were designed to handle these situations: devices would listen for
  activity before sending and retry if they detected a collision.
</p>
<p>
  Modern <strong>switched Ethernet</strong> avoids this problem by connecting
  each device to a central switch, which ensures that messages are forwarded
  only between the correct sender and receiver ports—removing collisions
  entirely. ![[switched_ethernet_tanenbum.png| 420]]
</p>
<p>
  Beyond sending messages to known MAC addresses, the link layer sometimes needs
  to <strong>discover</strong> who’s connected locally. Protocols like
  <strong>ARP</strong> (Address Resolution Protocol) help map an IP address
  (used at the network layer) to the corresponding MAC address needed at the
  link layer.
</p>
<p>
  To keep messages reliable, link-layer frames may also include
  <strong
    ><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer#Error_detection_and_correction"
      >error detection</a
    ></strong
  >
  mechanisms like
  <strong
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"
      >CRC checksums</a
    ></strong
  >
  in the trailer. If corruption is detected, the frame can be dropped and higher
  layers (like TCP) may request a retransmission.
</p>
<p>The link layer is where the idea of a “network” begins to take shape:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Within a LAN, devices communicate directly using MAC addresses.</li>
  <li>
    But to reach devices outside this local segment—on another LAN or across the
    Internet—we need a higher-level addressing scheme:
    <strong>IP addresses</strong>, handled at the network layer (covered next).
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>MAC address, LAN, contention, frames, ARP, CRC</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. Network Layer: Routing Across Networks</h2>
<p>
  Once your message can reach other machines on the same local network (thanks
  to the link+physical layers),
  <strong
    >how do you send it across the world—from your laptop in Paris to a server
    in New York?</strong
  >
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Figuring out a path <em>across</em> local networks through routers is the job
  of the network layer. This task is known as <em>routing</em>.
</p>
<p>
  At this level, devices are no longer just direct neighbors—they’re nodes in a
  vast mesh of interconnected networks: an <strong>internetwork</strong> (hence,
  the "Internet").
</p>
<p>
  To make sense of this global web, each device’s network interface is assigned
  an <strong>IP address</strong>. Unlike MAC addresses (which only identify
  devices within the same local network), the IP address space has a
  hierarchical structure to make large-scale routing efficient and scalable. IP
  addresses are actually divided into:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a network portion used find the correct LAN within the larger network</li>
  <li>
    and a host portion used to pinpoint the precise destination machine in the
    end.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Originally, this network/host split was <em>fixed</em>. Nowadays, the split is
  dynamic. Each IP address is associated to a binary
  <strong>subnet mask</strong> which defines how much of the address (how many
  bytes) refers to the network and how much to the host (see class vs
  classless). ![[IP_address_ANDed_with_subnetmask.png|400]]
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Bitwise AND operation on IP address + subnet mask yields the network portion
    of the address.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Once a packet finds its way to the final LAN, it's the link layer's
  responsibility to deliver it to the right machine - mapping the host portion
  of the IP address to the correct local MAC address.
</p>
<p>
  As the address space is hierarchical, intermediary routers do not need to know
  about the <em>entire</em> network. Local information is sufficient to the
  extent each router can make this one-hop decision:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>where to forward the packet next ?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Routers make this decision using their routing tables stored <em>locally</em>.
  These tables only store local, partial (!) knowledge about the entire network.
  The goal of forwarding a packet is to move it closer to its destination OR to
  a router with better information about where to send it next.
</p>
<p>
  Once a router has made its forwarding decision, it updates the link-layer
  header/trailer to point to the next-hop machine. Link layer data is very local
  and changes on a hop-to-hop basis. Link headers/trailers are stripped, read
  and re-written/added at each hop while the IP-level encapsulation information
  stays constant. The original source and the final destination are constant,
  while intermediary routers are discovered as the message is being sent.
</p>
<p>
  Actually, IP has a mechanism to avoid a packet losing its way and hoping
  between routers indefinitely. It counts the number of hops the packet has made
  and cap it at a certain number, the TTL. Each router decrements the TTL value
  by one. If TTL reaches zero, the packet is dropped (TTL is a
  <em>hop limit</em>, not a time limit). So IP packets stay unchanged besides
  the TTL (which is decremented) across hops while the inner link header is
  modified to point to the next machine.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  This TTL feature is actually used <code>traceroute</code> to detect
  intermediary routers. See below the hops to go from my computer to
  example.com: ![[traceroute_example_dot_com_dump.png|400]]
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    my computer --> my internet box (192.168/16 is within

  </li>
  <li>box --> where my fiber ends ("ISP's first point of presence")</li>
  <li>
    this ISP first node --> regional center ("tou" --> Toulouse) for my ISP
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      bunch of "***": intermediary hops that do not respond to the TTL-exceeded
      packets which are used by traceroute to detect them (common behavior)

        routers)
      </li>
      <li>
        then packets go to

        US routers ("snjsca" --> San Jose/Santa Clara)
      </li>
      <li>and finally reaching the server hosting example.com In summary:</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  However, IP does not add any additional features of robustness/reliability:
  packets may be duplicated or received out of order, if they are received at
  all: connectionless, <em>datagrams</em>. Packets may also be fragmented into
  smaller packets, further complicating the delivery. IP is even stateless:
  packets are dealt with independantly of each other. There is no memory of
  previous packets or information about future ones. This stands in stark
  contrast to what the next layer does when using TCP.

<h2>4. Transport Layer: Reliability &#x26; Connections (TCP, UDP)</h2>
<p>
  With the network layer on top of the link and physical, we can route packets
  from computer A to computer B. But communication is unreliable. How do we add
  reliability to communications over unreliable channels ? How can a process on
  machine A "connect" with another process running on machine B ?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  The transport layer, with TCP, adds reliability features to the network layer.
  Actually, TCP provides a <em>best effort</em> at reliability
  (acknowledgements, retransmissions). This means it will detect communication
  failures and will warn the application using its service about them. TCP also
  controls the
  <a
    href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#congestion-avoidance-and-control"
    ><em>flow</em> of communication</a
  >
  to avoid both:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>overwhelming the receiver (control flow)</li>
  <li>
    overwhelming the network itself (<em>congestion</em> control) UDP, on the
    other hand, does not add these and can be though of as a thin wrapper
    protocol over IP - a "<a
      href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-udp/#null-protocol-services"
      >null protocol</a
    >". With UDP, the communication stays connectionless, while TCP "elevates"
    the network datagram service to
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_circuit#Layer_4_virtual_circuits"
      >virtual-circuit</a
    >esque segments.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that TCP is not strictly superior over UDP: the added reliability comes
  at some
  <a href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/">performance costs</a> -
  setting up the connection (3-way handshakes), or sending additional messages
  to acknowledge receptions for instance, see ACKs - which may be well worth the
  price in some situation and not in others. For example UDP is often chosen for
  real-time applications like video streaming where low latency matters more
  than reliability.
</p>
<p>
  TCP three-way handshake with SYNs and ACKs:

    alt="TCP three-way handshake|400"
  />
</p>
<p>
  TCP and UDP also add the notion of <em>ports</em> which allow communication
  not only to happen between two computers, but actually between two processes:
  more precision. Think of ports are like an additional argument of type integer
  in methods like <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>. So addressing can
  now use IP to pinpoint a machine on the larger network and the port number to
  add extra information about which process exactly should be receiving the
  message.

<h2>5. Application Layer: From Bytes to Meaning (HTTP, DNS, SMTP...)</h2>
<p>
  And finally, application layer protocols like HTTP or DNS can focus on how
  data is structured and interpreted by applications
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Application layer defines the shape and meaning of the messages apps exchange
  to communicate information. This information is wrapped in the many
  lower-layer protocol headers and is, generally, only visible at the end to the
  higher level application that sent/received this content to begin with.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Your browser sends HTTP GET request bytes via TCP, receiving bytes that
    represent the HTML page.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The application layer is where the semantics of application is written: for
  example HTTP to request the content of a web-page, or SMTP to get/send emails.
</p>
<p>
  Application protocols and standards are defined in public specification
  documents (see RFCs) and are built on top of lower layers. For instance, HTTP
  assumes a TCP service.
</p>
<h1>Layer Interaction: Data Flow through the Stack</h1>
<p>
  Together, these layers form an abstraction tower that allows applications
  running on distant computers to communicate over a diverse and messy physical
  infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Summary of each layer unit of communication with some protocol examples:</p>
<p>
  | Layer | Unit | Protocol Examples | Purpose | | ----------- | ------- |
  ----------------- | ------------------------------- | | Application | message
  | HTTP, DNS, SMTP | Meaningful data exchange | | Transport | segment | TCP,
  UDP | Reliability, process-to-process | | Network | packet | IP | Routing
  between networks | | Link | frame | Ethernet, Wi-FI | Local delivery within
  network | | Physical | signal | NRZ, Manchester | Bit-level transmission |
</p>
<p>
  Let's see an example. When you browse a web page, your browser uses HTTP to
  formulate its requests to a server.
</p>
<p>
  See client-server situation: ![[Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 10.25.56.png | 420]]
</p>
<p>
  These requests travels over TCP/IP. IP handles addressing across networks; TCP
  ensures reliable delivery. Lower layers like Ethernet handle local transfers,
  using MAC addresses. Auxiliary protocols are often involved - for instance to
  "discover" the IP-to-MAC address mappings (e.g. ARP).
</p>
<p>
  In this sense, TCP and IP from the fundation of the internet, on top of which
  HTTP - an "app" relative to the network - can run.
</p>
<p>
  See the protocol stack involved for the client/server communication, with
  routers in between: ![[Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 07.37.58.png | 420]]
</p>
<p>
  Wikipedia illustration of data encapsulation with colors:
  ![[wikipedia_encapsulation_with_colors.png|400]]
</p>
<p>
  Data flows down the stack on the one machine, is sent physically, and then
  flows up the stack on the next machine. This happens multiple times until the
  message arrives at its final destination (the server). In between the client
  and the server, a number of intermediary machines like routers will relay the
  messages forward closer to destination. These intermediate nodes need only
  read and (re)write only relevant lower-layer headers to forward messages.
</p>
<p>
  During communication, every layer assumes the existance of its "peer" on the
  destination machine. This "peer" is another instance of the layer, simply
  running on another computer. Both should therefore "speak" the same protocol.
  Layers can safely add additional information to messages by encapsulating them
  with headers (and sometimes trailers) - trusting that the peer layer will
  correctly decode the new header/trailer and process them properly, as
  specified by their protocol.
</p>
<p>
  Once a layer completes its task, it typically passes control or returns the
  results back up to the layer above it, which originally requested its services
